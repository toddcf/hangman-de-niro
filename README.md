# Hangman - Robert De Niro Edition

## Checklist

- Finish styling CSS.
- Display incorrect letters guessed in HTML.
  - If the user guesses the same letter twice, use an animation to shake that letter and temporarily change it to red in either the blanks section or the incorrect guesses section.
- If player loses round, display what the title was.
- At end of round, display the full title and score BEFORE the confirm box pops up.
- Add favicon.
- Add start button instead of automatically triggering the game upon loading page.
  - Hide start button when game begins.
  - Display "Play Again?" button when game ends.
- Animate the blanks as they appear.
- Mobile responsiveness.
- Is there a way to not repeat array elements?
  - If so, either set it to not repeat until all titles have been displayed once. Or . . .
  - Once all have been guessed, inform them that they have beaten the game, and stop.
